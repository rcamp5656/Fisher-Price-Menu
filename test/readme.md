Test scad exports

.fpr are created with the 'Music Box Tune Tracker' and exported to .scad with the fpr_to_scad.py python script suffixed with _mmtt

the same .fpr file is exported to scad using 'Fred Record Player' and suffixed with _fpre.

The two files may be used to test the the 'Music Box Tune Tracker' export the same results as 'Fred Record Player'.
