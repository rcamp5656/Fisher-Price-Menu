# Fisher-Price-Menu

A lot of people have asked me basically how do I install Python to make the Fisher Price Records and have all of the scripts work.

First thing is that you have to install the latest version of Python.

Second thing is that you have to install version 2022 of Microsoft Visual Studio Tools.

Third thing is that you have to install the 2021 version of Open Scad.

Dependencies for Python are needed.

Go to your command prompt as administrator.

Type in the following:

pip install unicurses

pip install wheel

pip install mido

pip install python-rtmidi

pin install setuptools wheel

pip install â€“upgrade setuptools wheel

pip install playsound

Once you have this all installed , you need to convert your MIDI files with Music Box Maniacs Create, I have enclosed some already
converted midi files in a folder called maniacs plus some 2000 plus midi files.

The batch file that you would run is fisherpricecreate, make sure that you have no spaces in your MIDI filenames.
There are also some finished scad files and stl files that are ready to go, they are once sided, it is best to print
one-sided and glue them together as a two sided piece. There is two sided also just follow the prompts in my batch file.

The QB64 program is not yet finished I will be working on it too...

It just needs to have the entire batch file inserted as shell comands, that will be done later on.
