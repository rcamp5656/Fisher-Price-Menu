# Fisher-Price-Menu

A lot of people have asked me basically how do I install Python to make the Fisher Price Records and have all of the scripts work.

First thing is that you have to install the latest version of Python.
Second thing is that you have to install version 2022 of Microsoft Visual Studio Tools
Third thing is that you have to install the 2021 version of Open Scad

Dependencies for Python are needed.

Go to your command prompt as administrator.

Type in the following:

pip install unicurses
pip install wheel
pip install mido
pip install python-rtmidi
pin install setuptools wheel
pip install â€“upgrade setuptools wheel
pip install playsound
